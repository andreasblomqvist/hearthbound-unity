## 🧪 Testing the Connection

You can now test the Unity MCP integration! Try these commands in Cursor:

### Example Commands:
1. **List scene objects:**
   > "List all GameObjects in the current Unity scene"

2. **Create a script:**
   > "Create a new C# script called `PlayerHealth` that has a `TakeDamage` function"

3. **Get scene info:**
   > "What GameObjects are in the current scene hierarchy?"

4. **Modify GameObjects:**
   > "In the current scene, find the Main Camera and add a Rigidbody component to it"

### How to Use:
- Make sure Unity Editor is running with the MCP server online
- Type your request in Cursor's chat
- The AI will use MCP to interact with Unity directly!

## 📝 Notes

- The Library folder is generated by Unity when you first open the project
- The MCP package path will be created after installing the package in Unity
- Make sure Unity Editor is running when using MCP commands in Cursor
- The server must be started in Unity before Cursor can connect

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. **Server not starting:** Verify Node.js is in PATH (already verified ✅)
2. **Cursor can't connect:** Ensure server is running in Unity and path in `mcp_servers.json` is correct
3. **Commands failing:** Check Unity Console for error messages
4. **Firewall issues:** Ensure port 8090 is not blocked
